## Blog App in Flask
<p> This is a simple blog app that I developed in 1 day without any prior knowledge of Flask with the help of a tutorial. </p>
### Things I learnt from this project
<p> Flask is easy to learn if you have prior knowledge of Django or any such framework and plus it is lightweight, can be used to develop simple websites. </p>
